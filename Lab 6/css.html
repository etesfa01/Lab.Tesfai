            <p>Welcome to my site. Please come in and stay awhile.</p>
            <p>I started this web site because Halloween has always been my favorite holiday. But during the last
                year, I started selling some of my favorite Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit. </p>
            <p>If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween pictures, stories, and films.
                And if you join my email list, I will keep you up-to-date on all things Halloween.</p>
